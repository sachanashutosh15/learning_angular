Binding Syntax:
    - Interpolation / -> {{}}
    - Property Binding / -> <div [hidden]="isHidden">Div Content</div>
    - Event Binding / -> <button (click)="toggle()">Toggle</button>

Directives:
    - Directives are used to change the behaviour and appearance of DOM element.
    - Directives can implement all life cycle hooks.
    - Directives can not have template.

    Two types:
        - Structural Directives
        - Attribute Directives

    rooms?.availableRooms ?? "No rooms" / -> if rooms is defined and rooms.availableRooms
                                            is truthy value then that value else "No rooms"

    directives with * are structural directives
        - can add or remove elements from the DOM.
    directives without * are attribute directives
        - can modify the elements but can't add or remove elements.

    *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwich, ngClass, ngStyle

Pipes:
    - Pipes are used for data transformation.
    - Pipes don't change actual object.

    DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, TitleCase CurrencyPipe, DecimalPipe, PercentPipe,
    JsonPipe, SlicePipe, AsyncPipe
